## ðŸ”— Credits

This project is heavily based on [GrammaTech](https://grammatech.github.io/) [GTIRB](https://grammatech.github.io/prj/gtirb/) project.

> [!NOTE]
> Original GTIRB project has multiple APIs in different languages, including C++, Python, Java and Common Lisp that are based on the [protobuf schemas](https://github.com/GrammaTech/gtirb/tree/master/proto). As generated Rust code from protobuf is not optimal, this project aims to provide a more idiomatic Rust API for GTIRB by implemeting data structures from scratch.
